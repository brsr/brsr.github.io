# About Me
I'm a data scientist living in Upstate New York. I hold a BS in Applied Mathematics from the [University of Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu/) and a MS in Environmental Engineering Sciences from the [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu). Currently I work in property and casualty insurance.

I live near [Utica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York), between Syracuse and Albany. No, not Utica Avenue in Brooklyn. I'm not close to New York City at all. Yes, I've heard of [steamed hams](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/steamed-hams). Also, [please don't burn Utica to the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKuMfrz_G7w): I like it here.
