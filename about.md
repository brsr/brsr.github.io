# About Me
I'm a data scientist living in Upstate New York. I hold a BS in Applied Mathematics from the [University of Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu/) and a MS in Environmental Engineering Sciences from the [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu). Currently I work in property and casualty insurance.

I live near [Utica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York), between Syracuse and Albany. No, not Utica Avenue in Brooklyn. I'm not close to New York City at all. Yes, I've heard of [steamed hams](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Steamed_Hams). Also, [please don't burn Utica to the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKuMfrz_G7w): I like it here.

# About This Site
I mostly use this site as storage for various small mathematical, geometric, and/or programming projects. Some entries are back-dated, reflecting when I actually did the project rather than when I got around to writing a blog entry about it.

This site is built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using a modified version of the [Midnight](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight) theme.

Thanks are due to [Brian Hood, Jonathan Turley, Jonathan Zittrain, David Faber, and Guido Scorza](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/certain-names-make-chatgpt-grind-to-a-halt-and-we-know-why/).
