[Antitile](https://github.com/brsr/antitile) is a Python package for manipulating polyhedra and tilings. It is largely a collection of add-ons and scripts to be used with for Adrian Rossiter's [Antiprism](http://www.antiprism.com/), but can be used on its own. Documentation is available [on readthedocs.io](https://antitile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The most interesting programs in the package are these:

* `gcopoly.py`: The Goldberg-Coxeter subdivision operation of tilings. Basically it makes things that look like geodesic domes, or the quadrilateral-faced analog of geodesic domes. Antiprism itself implemented the triangular version of this in the `geodesic`, but not the quadrilateral case. This also implementes a handful of new projections.
* `balloon.py`: Balloon tiling of the sphere. Take a regular triangular or quad grid, wrap it around a sphere in a certain way.
* `cellular.py`: Colors polyhedra (faces or vertices) using cellular automata.
* `view_off.py`: Viewer for `.off` files, the format used by Antiprism. Antiprism has `antiview` but I wanted something to create `.svg` files.

[Roger Kaufman from the Antiprism Google group](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/antiprism/hyKdjk-iwOI/2fV6QyZIAQAJ) made an animation using `gcopoly.py` and `cellular.py`, using the rules of Conway's Game of Life:
