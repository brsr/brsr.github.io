A paper from 2012, [The Regular Grünbaum Polyhedron of Genus 5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6588), includes a polyhedron of genus 5 that is an embedding of the {3,8} [regular map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_map_(graph_theory)). This polyhedron can be recreated using the `wythoff` program in [Antiprism](http://www.antiprism.com/), although the exact proportions are a little different in the paper.
