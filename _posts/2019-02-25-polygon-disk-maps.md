title: "Mappings between Disks and Polygons"
tags: python jupyter

Mappings between squares and disks have applications in computer graphics, and are interesting mathematically. Mappings between triangles and disks are less well-studied, but also interesting.
Both can also be used as map projections in combination with a map projection from a hemisphere to a disk. [In this Jupyter notebook,](https://github.com/brsr/math/blob/master/Mappings%20from%20polygons%20to%20the%20disk.ipynb) I implemented a bunch of mappings from disks to triangles and squares and calculated their area and conformal distortion.
