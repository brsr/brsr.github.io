I wrote an article for the Utica College Center of Public Affairs and Election Research blog,
["Why Oneida County briefly showed the most COVID-19 symptoms in Upstate NY"](https://www.ucpublicaffairs.com/home/2020/5/2/why-oneida-county-briefly-showed-the-most-covid-19-symptoms-in-upstate-ny-by-brenton-recht). Spoiler alert: it's statistical noise from a small sample size.

Python code for the graphs is [available on Gist](https://gist.github.com/brsr/51e0487b2f84691490a1b3c6b1c22354).

Postscript, 2020-08-13: The spike in Oneida County did, indeed, turn out to be a blip. Another outlier that was nationally noticed was in Navajo County, Arizona; unfortunately, [that turned out to be real](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2020/08/13/covid-indian-country-navajo-women-elders/).
