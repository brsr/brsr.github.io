title: "Lines in the Poincaré Disk Model of Hyperbolic Geometry"
tags: python jupyter
---

I was inspired by a friend's [alchemical hypergeometric function notation](https://society6.com/product/a-hypergeometric-transformation_print?sku=s6-3862893p4a1v45) to see how similar drawings looked on the hyperbolic [Poincaré disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model). Drawing lines on the Poincaré disk is actually easier using compass and paper than using a computer: on a computer, you have to actually calculate the radius, center, and points of intersection of the circular arc. [See all the steps in the Jupyter notebook on Github.](https://github.com/brsr/math/blob/master/Lines%20on%20the%20Hyperbolic%20Poincare%20Disk.ipynb)
