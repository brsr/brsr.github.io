I've written an R package that implements the trimmed Spearman-Karber method for dose-response curves. [It's available on Github.](https://github.com/brsr/tsk)

This package was implemented before R 3 was released, so its idiom may be a little outdated. I am also not a professional biostatistician: I was asked to implement this method at a previous workplace. If anyone is interested in taking over maintenance of this package, or adding it to an appropriate package, please contact me.
