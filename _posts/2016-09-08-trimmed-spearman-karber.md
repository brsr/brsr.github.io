I've written an R package that implements the trimmed Spearman-Karber method for dose-response curves. [It's available on Github.](https://github.com/brsr/tsk)

I was asked to implement this method at a previous job, based on [a journal article](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es60130a004), and recieved permission to release it as open-source software. This package was implemented before R 3 was released, so its idiom may be a little outdated. I am also not a professional biostatistician. If anyone is interested in taking over maintenance of this package, or adding it to an appropriate package, please contact me.
