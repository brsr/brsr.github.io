title: "Chaos from an Exponential Decay Process"
tags: python jupyter
---
Simple exponential decay can be manipulated to create chaos like the logistic map. There are also connections with the softplus function used in machine learning. [A Jupyter Notebook with analysis can be viewed on my Github.](https://github.com/brsr/math/blob/master/Chaos%20from%20Exponential%20Decay.ipynb)
